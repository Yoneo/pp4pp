# pp4pp - Privacy Policies for Apps

This is a mini site where I put my learnings from working on iubenda for app creators. Comments, feedback and push requests welcomed.

To get started, checkout <http://s2imon.github.io/pp4pp>!



## Quick access

Core to this site are several guides for adding the privacy policies to the app stores:

## Minimum requirements for a mobile privacy policy

*who they are (identity and contact details),
*what precise categories of personal data the app wants to collect and process,
*why the data processing is necessary (for what precise purposes),
*whether data will be disclosed to third parties (not just a generic but a specific description to whom the data will be disclosed),
*what rights users have, in terms of withdrawal of consent and deletion of data;
