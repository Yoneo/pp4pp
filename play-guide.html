			<p>Welcome. This page mainly answers the <strong>question how and why you should add a privacy policy to your Android app</strong>.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>If you want to read a more general <a href="http://www.iubenda.com/blog/2013/06/10/the-need-for-privacy-policies-in-mobile-apps-an-overview/">overview of privacy policies in mobile apps</a> then you can read that here</li>

			<p>Since we've launched our <a href="http://iubenda.com/en/mobile/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=android_guide">mobile apps privacy policy generator</a> last week I've been wondering how good the documentation was out there regarding "privacy policy for an Android app" or "privacy policy for an iOS app" and&nbsp;"privacy policy for a Windows Phone app". So googling the said term reveals a rather sad picture of useless information. Let's fix it.</p>
			<p><strong>Update 14.6.2013:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>You can now find a similar privacy policy guide for Windows Phone here: <a href="http://www.iubenda.com/blog/2013/06/14/privacy-policy-for-windows-phone-apps/">Privacy Policy for Windows Phone Apps</a></li>

			<p>Let's say <strong>I want to include a privacy policy into my Android application</strong>: what do I need to do?</p>
			<div class="well well-large well-iubenda">
			<h2>In Short</h2>
			<p>We have a slightly different flow in place for mobile privacy policies than for the web version:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><a href="http://iubenda.com/en/mobile/">Use our generator</a> for mobile apps;</li>
			<li>Add all the clauses you need for your app to your privacy policy and then:
			<ol>
			<li>Embed it into your app or link to it from the app;</li>
			<li>Possibly link to it from the app store;</li>
			<li>Possibly link to it from your website;</li>
			<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.iubenda.com/blog/2014/02/07/privacy-policy-app-store-guide-link/">Read here how to properly add a privacy policy to a mobile app</a></li>
			</ul>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Be happy.</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<h3>1) Do I have to include a privacy policy in my Android app?</h3>
			<ol>
			<li>Well, that depends on what the app is doing. But consider the fact, that you can never be wrong including a link or a full page view of your privacy policy.It is however very likely that you are <a href="http://www.iubenda.com/blog/2013/06/10/the-need-for-privacy-policies-in-mobile-apps-an-overview/">required by law to include a privacy policy</a> into your Android baby. Easy CHECK: <strong>Am I collecting/storing/sharing personal information</strong> like email, names or sensitive data like payments info or using a third party service that accesses my info?</li>
			<li>You are likely using a third party service in your app that requires you to add a privacy policy to your app. Additionally to a legal requirement it is often an additional prerequisite to use a specific service. Check in your service provider's terms. A very popular third party service that requires you to post a <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">privacy policy in their TOS</a> is Google Analytics (they also have a mobile solution).</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>2) Am I required by the Google Play Store to post a privacy policy?</h3>
			<ol>
			<li>For now (posted 13.6.2013) this is a resounding "no". The Play store does not require you <a href="http://play.google.com/intl/en/about/play-terms.html">in their terms</a> to add a privacy policy. You can therefore post an app to the store that is non-compliant with privacy laws. From the Google Play docs: "This is an optional field that Google provides to developers who want to share their privacy policy with users - these privacy policies are written by the app developers and are not evaluated by Google". This does not however excempt you from any of your obligations.</li>
			<li>The California Attorney General is working on making all apps privacy regulations compliant and working on this with the big platform providers like Google Play. This situation could therefore change down the road.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here's a document called <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/2519872?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2364761">Developer Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;for Android&nbsp;on the Google's support pages.</p>
			<h3>3) How do I add/edit my privacy policy on the Play store? (<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/2519872">source</a>)</h3>
			<ol>
			<li>Log into your&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/v2/">Google Play Developer Console</a></li>
			<li>Next, select&nbsp;<strong>All Applications</strong>&nbsp;and select the application whose privacy policy you'd like to edit.</li>
			<li>After that, select&nbsp;<strong>Store Listing</strong>.</li>
			<li>Then, scroll to the section marked&nbsp;<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>&nbsp;and enter the URL where you have the privacy policy hosted online.</li>
			<li>Lastly, be sure to click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>4) What if I donâ€™t want to add a privacy policy at this time?</h3>
			<p>If you do not want to add a privacy policy at the moment, you can check the box next to<strong>Not submitting a privacy policy URL at this time</strong>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<strong>Store Listings</strong>&nbsp;screen of your application in the&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/v2/">Google Play Developer Console</a>. Follow the instructions above to view that screen.</p>
			<h3>5) An example privacy policy for Android Apps?</h3>
			<p>A lot of people ask for sample privacy policies for apps. Let's start with the legal minimum requirements. A good starting point is the California Online Privacy Protection act (CalOPPA), and even better Europe's minimum requirements since they are more refined:</p>
			<h4>CalOPPA minimum requirements:</h4>
			<p>Provide info about the personally identifiable information (PII) like:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>a description of the types of PII collected and disclosed by the operator;</li>
			<li>a description of the process by which a consumer can access and request changes to his or her PII, if available;</li>
			<li>a description of the process by which the operator will notify consumers of material changes to the privacy policy; and</li>
			<li>an effective date</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>EU Privacy Directives minimum requirements:</h4>
			<p>Provide a readable, understandable and easily accessible privacy policy, which at a minimum informs users about:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>who you are (identity and contact details),</li>
			<li>what precise categories of personal data the app wants to collect and process,</li>
			<li>why the data processing is necessary (for what precise purposes),</li>
			<li>whether data will be disclosed to third parties (not just a generic but a specific<br>
			description to whom the data will be disclosed),</li>
			<li>what rights users have, in terms of withdrawal of consent and deletion of data</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can easily google for an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=privacy+policy+for+android+app"><strong>example privacy policy for X</strong></a> but chances are you won't find anything ready-made.</p>
			<p><strong>Helpful docs</strong>:</p>

			<h3>Our Approach of Generating an Android Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>So here's where <a href="http://iubenda.com/en/mobile/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=android_guide">iubenda's privacy policy generator</a> will come in very handy:</p>
			<p>1) Define the services and categories of data collection your app is making use of.</p>
			<p>2) Add the services (and categories of data collection like "access to address book") you are using to your policy and it will generate the full text privacy policy in a condensed easily scannable fashion as well as an entire document your users can read if they want.</p>
			<p>3) You can either link to your policy or embed the text into your app.</p>
